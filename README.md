# RCS_2023_winter_project

The RCS_2023_winter_project, hosted at Korea Aerospace University from December 30, 2023, to February 29, 2024, encompasses a comprehensive study on basic robotics, focusing on two-link planar and three-link planar robots, covering theoretical foundations, MATLAB simulations for circle drawing, and practical implementations of three-link planar robot using Arduino with Dynamixel motors.
